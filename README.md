# Hello!

## This is my repo for Programming with Data Spring 2022! It contains work from lab activities and other lessons.

### Here are some fun things in Markdown!

My name is **Priya** and I'm a *psychology* major! I am minoring in *criminology*. 

Here is a really cool programming quote:

 > "Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program" - Linus Torvalds
 
Some basic Markdown syntax you will see in my .md docs include:

```
# H1
## H2
### H3

**bold**
*italics*

> quote

1. list item 1
2. list item 2

- unordered list item 1
- unordered list item 2
```
