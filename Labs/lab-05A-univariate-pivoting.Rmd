# Exercise 1
## This data is in tidy format because the columns are variables and are matched with rows that have observations.

# E 1.2
```{r}
(lotr_wide <- lotr |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(-Species, -Words), 
              names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Words))
```

# E 1.3
```{r}
# remember quotations :)
lotr_wide |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = Elf:Man, 
               names_to  = "Species", 
               values_to = "Words")
